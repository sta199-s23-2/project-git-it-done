These data contain reviews of 1312 arabica and 28 robusta coffee beans from the Coffee Quality Institute’s trained reviewers.\nEach observation is a review on a type of coffee.\nThere doesn’t seem to be any evident ethical concerns.\nRESEARCH QUESTION\nWhat is the relationship between the average altitude of the farm and the sweetness level of the coffee based on the country where the coffee was produced?\nThis question is important because the results of this study will demonstrate which country and at which altitude the coffee will be the sweetest or least sweet. This information will be important for coffee farmers who wish to produce sweet coffee (or vice versa) for their customers.\nOur research will investigate the relationship between the average altitude of farm where the coffee is grown and the sweetness level of the coffee produced based on the country where the coffee was produced. We hypothesize that there will be a positive correlation between the altitude and sweetness, because the literature showed that coffee beans grown at higher altitudes made coffee with a better taste.\nThe variable “Location.Country” (country where the coffee is produced) is a categorical variable, whereas the variables “Data.Scores.Sweetness” (sweetness level of the coffee on a scale of 1-10) and “Location.Altitude.Average” (the average altitude of the farm in which the coffee was grown) are quantitative variables.\nOther variables to consider would be the minimum and maximum altitudes (and the range between those two values) since our research question depends on the average altitude. One could investigate the changes in sweetness between these maximum and minimum altitude values of specific locations to supplement the research from our question about comparing countries.\nOne variable we want to control is the year, because climate/weather differences vary by year, so measuring sweetness would be best relegated to data from the same year.\nAnother variable to control would be Data.Type.Processing method, because that process would alter the condition of the coffee after its growth and thus it could affect sweetness levels.\nLITERATURE\nThis research article discusses the research into the sensory information about four different types of coffee, and how these attributes compared when coffee was grown at two different altitudes in the San Martin region of Peru. There was a 200 meter difference in the altitudes of coffee being grown and an ample amount – 1500g – of each type of coffee was grown in each location. Sensory factors “such as aroma, taste, aftertaste, acidity, body, consistency, balance, cleanliness of the cup, sweetness and beverage quality” were measured based on tables approved by the Specialty Coffee Association of America (SCAA). Moreover, the coffee tasters used to assess the coffee for this experiment were “certified by the Cooperativa Agraria Cafetalera y de Servicios Oro Verde”. \nOur research builds on the research described in this article, because it is comparing sweetness (a sensory attribute) of coffee harvested at different altitudes in a variety of regions worldwide, not just the San Martin region of Peru.\nWorks Cited:\nLiliana, E.

    "text": "## Introduction and Data\n\nOur topic is UFO sightings.\nOur topic for this project is UFOs, or “Unidentified Flying Objects”. UFOs as proof of alien life are largely writen off as pseudoscience by the scientific community, but this does not take away from the fact that there are tens of thousands of sightings reported annually. In 2020, the Pentagon released videos of unidentified flying objects, sparking the intrigue of enthusiasts and skeptics alike. This is outlined in a New York Times article that also highlights how the government has been looking into unidentified aerial phenomena (UAF; another term for UFO) since the 1950s; articles like these add merit to our research into consistencies in examining UFOs worldwide. Links to NYT article: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/us/pentagon-ufo-videos.html\nThe research question we have landed on is the following: What is the relationship between the UFO shape and the length of the encounter time (in seconds) based on the country in which the UFO sighting was reported? Our hope is that this will help examine consistencies and contradictory data when investigating UFO reports worldwide.\nEthical issues do not seem to exist with this data, because we do not have any personal information about the sources of the data. All of the data is anonymous and has no identifying information which eliminates ethical concerns.\n## Methodology\n```f3175f2a-e8a0-4436-be12-b33925b6d220\n31b8e172-b470-440e-83d8-e6b185028602:dAB5AHAAZQA6AFoAZwBBAHoAQQBEAEUAQQBOAHcAQQAxAEEARwBZAEEATQBnAEIAaABBAEMAMABBAFoAUQBBADQAQQBHAEUAQQBNAEEAQQB0AEEARABRAEEATgBBAEEAegBBAEQAWQBBAEwAUQBCAGkAQQBHAFUAQQBNAFEAQQB5AEEAQwAwAEEAWQBnAEEAegBBAEQATQBBAE8AUQBBAHkAQQBEAFUAQQBZAGcAQQAyAEEARwBRAEEATQBnAEEAeQBBAEQAQQBBAAoAcABvAHMAaQB0AGkAbwBuADoATQBnAEEANABBAEQASQBBAAoAcAByAGUAZgBpAHgAOgAKAHMAbwB1AHIAYwBlADoAWQBBAEIAZwBBAEcAQQBBAGUAdwBCAHkAQQBIADAAQQBDAGcAQQBqAEEASAB3AEEASQBBAEIAcwBBAEcARQBBAFkAZwBCAGwAQQBHAHcAQQBPAGcAQQBnAEEARwAwAEEAWgBRAEIAMABBAEcAZwBBAGIAdwBCAGsAQQBHADgAQQBiAEEAQgB2AEEARwBjAEEAZQBRAEEASwBBAEEAbwBBAGQAUQBCAG0AQQBHADgAQQBYAHcAQgB6AEEARwBrAEEAWgB3AEIAbwBBAEgAUQBBAGEAUQBCAHUAQQBHAGMAQQBjAHcAQQBnAEEARAB3AEEATABRAEEAZwBBAEgASQBBAFoAUQBCAGgAQQBHAFEAQQBjAGcAQQA2AEEARABvAEEAYwBnAEIAbABBAEcARQBBAFoAQQBCAGYAQQBHAE0AQQBjAHcAQgAyAEEAQwBnAEEASQBnAEIAbwBBAEgAUQBBAGQAQQBCAHcAQQBIAE0AQQBPAGcAQQB2AEEAQwA4AEEAYwBnAEIAaABBAEgAYwBBAEwAZwBCAG4AQQBHAGsAQQBkAEEAQgBvAEEASABVAEEAWQBnAEIAMQBBAEgATQBBAFoAUQBCAHkAQQBHAE0AQQBiAHcAQgB1AEEASABRAEEAWgBRAEIAdQBBAEgAUQBBAEwAZwBCAGoAQQBHADgAQQBiAFEAQQB2AEEASABJAEEAWgBnAEIAdgBBAEgASQBBAFoAQQBCAGgAQQBIAFEAQQBZAFEAQgB6AEEARwBNAEEAYQBRAEIAbABBAEcANABBAFkAdwBCAGwAQQBDADgAQQBkAEEAQgBwAEEARwBRAEEAZQBRAEIAMABBAEgAVQBBAFoAUQBCAHoAQQBHAFEAQQBZAFEAQgA1AEEAQwA4AEEAYgBRAEIAaABBAEgATQBBAGQAQQBCAGwAQQBIAEkAQQBMAHcAQgBrAEEARwBFAEEAZABBAEIAaABBAEMAOABBAE0AZwBBAHcAQQBEAEUAQQBPAFEAQQB2AEEARABJAEEATQBBAEEAeABBAEQAawBBAEwAUQBBAHcAQQBEAFkAQQBMAFEAQQB5AEEARABVAEEATAB3AEIAMQBBAEcAWQBBAGIAdwBCAGYAQQBIAE0AQQBhAFEAQgBuAEEARwBnAEEAZABBAEIAcABBAEcANABBAFoAdwBCAHoAQQBDADQAQQBZAHcAQgB6AEEASABZAEEASQBnAEEAcABBAEEAbwBBAEMAZwBCAG4AQQBHAHcAQQBhAFEAQgB0AEEASABBAEEAYwB3AEIAbABBAEMAZwBBAGQAUQBCAG0AQQBHADgAQQBYAHcAQgB6AEEARwBrAEEAWgB3AEIAbwBBAEgAUQBBAGEAUQBCAHUAQQBHAGMAQQBjAHcAQQBwAEEAQQBvAEEAQwBnAEIAMQBBAEcAWQBBAGIAdwBCAGYAQQBIAE0AQQBhAFEAQgBuAEEARwBnAEEAZABBAEIAcABBAEcANABBAFoAdwBCAHoAQQBDAEEAQQBmAEEAQQArAEEAQQBvAEEASQBBAEEAZwBBAEcAUQBBAGMAZwBCAHYAQQBIAEEAQQBYAHcAQgB1AEEARwBFAEEASwBBAEIAagBBAEcAOABBAGQAUQBCAHUAQQBIAFEAQQBjAGcAQgA1AEEAQwB3AEEASQBBAEIAbABBAEcANABBAFkAdwBCAHYAQQBIAFUAQQBiAGcAQgAwAEEARwBVAEEAYwBnAEIAZgBBAEcAdwBBAFoAUQBCAHUAQQBHAGMAQQBkAEEAQgBvAEEAQwBrAEEASQBBAEIAOABBAEQANABBAEMAZwBBAGcAQQBDAEEAQQBaAHcAQgB5AEEARwA4AEEAZABRAEIAdwBBAEYAOABBAFkAZwBCADUAQQBDAGcAQQBkAFEAQgBtAEEARwA4AEEAWAB3AEIAegBBAEcAZwBBAFkAUQBCAHcAQQBHAFUAQQBLAFEAQQBnAEEASAB3AEEAUABnAEEASwBBAEMAQQBBAEkAQQBCAHoAQQBIAFUAQQBiAFEAQgB0AEEARwBFAEEAYwBnAEIAcABBAEgAbwBBAFoAUQBBAG8AQQBHADAAQQBaAFEAQgBoAEEARwA0AEEAWAB3AEIAMABBAEcAawBBAGIAUQBCAGwAQQBDAEEAQQBQAFEAQQBnAEEARwAwAEEAWgBRAEIAaABBAEcANABBAEsAQQBCAGwAQQBHADQAQQBZAHcAQgB2AEEASABVAEEAYgBnAEIAMABBAEcAVQBBAGMAZwBCAGYAQQBHAHcAQQBaAFEAQgB1AEEARwBjAEEAZABBAEIAbwBBAEMAawBBAEsAUQBBAGcAQQBBAG8AQQBDAGcAQgAxAEEARwBZAEEAYgB3AEIAZgBBAEgATQBBAGEAUQBCAG4AQQBHAGcAQQBkAEEAQgBwAEEARwA0AEEAWgB3AEIAegBBAEMAQQBBAGYAQQBBACsAQQBBAG8AQQBJAEEAQQBnAEEARwBjAEEAWgB3AEIAdwBBAEcAdwBBAGIAdwBCADAAQQBDAGcAQQBDAGcAQQBnAEEAQwBBAEEASQBBAEEAZwBBAEcARQBBAFoAUQBCAHoAQQBDAGcAQQBlAEEAQQBnAEEARAAwAEEASQBBAEIAMQBBAEcAWQBBAGIAdwBCAGYAQQBIAE0AQQBhAEEAQgBoAEEASABBAEEAWgBRAEEAcwBBAEMAQQBBAGUAUQBBAGcAQQBEADAAQQBJAEEAQgB0AEEARwBVAEEAWQBRAEIAdQBBAEYAOABBAGQAQQBCAHAAQQBHADAAQQBaAFEAQQBwAEEAQQBvAEEASQBBAEEAZwBBAEMAawBBAEkAQQBBAHIAQQBBAG8AQQBJAEEAQQBnAEEARwBjAEEAWgBRAEIAdgBBAEcAMABBAFgAdwBCAGoAQQBHADgAQQBiAEEAQQBvAEEAQwBrAEEASQBBAEEAcgBBAEEAbwBBAEkAQQBBAGcAQQBHAFkAQQBZAFEAQgBqAEEARwBVAEEAZABBAEIAZgBBAEgAYwBBAGMAZwBCAGgAQQBIAEEAQQBLAEEAQgArAEEARwBNAEEAYgB3AEIAMQBBAEcANABBAGQAQQBCAHkAQQBIAGsAQQBLAFEAQQByAEEAQQBvAEEASQBBAEEAZwBBAEcAdwBBAFkAUQBCAGkAQQBIAE0AQQBLAEEAQgA0AEEAQwBBAEEAUABRAEEAZwBBAEMASQBBAFYAUQBCAEcAQQBFADgAQQBJAEEAQgBUAEEARwBnAEEAWQBRAEIAdwBBAEcAVQBBAEkAZwBBAHMAQQBDAEEAQQBkAEEAQgBwAEEASABRAEEAYgBBAEIAbABBAEMAQQBBAFAAUQBBAGcAQQBDAEkAQQBWAFEAQgBHAEEARQA4AEEASQBBAEIAVABBAEcAZwBBAFkAUQBCAHcAQQBHAFUAQQBJAEEAQgBoAEEARwA0AEEAWgBBAEEAZwBBAEUAdwBBAFoAUQBCAHUAQQBHAGMAQQBkAEEAQgBvAEEAQwBBAEEAYQBRAEIAdQBBAEMAQQBBAGQAQQBCAG8AQQBHAFUAQQBJAEEAQgBWAEEARgBNAEEASQBnAEEAcABBAEMAQQBBAEsAdwBBAEsAQQBDAEEAQQBJAEEAQgAwAEEARwBnAEEAWgBRAEIAdABBAEcAVQBBAEsAQQBCAGgAQQBIAGcAQQBhAFEAQgB6AEEAQwA0AEEAZABBAEIAbABBAEgAZwBBAGQAQQBBAHUAQQBIAGcAQQBJAEEAQQA5AEEAQwBBAEEAWgBRAEIAcwBBAEcAVQBBAGIAUQBCAGwAQQBHADQAQQBkAEEAQgBmAEEASABRAEEAWgBRAEIANABBAEgAUQBBAEsAQQBCAGgAQQBHADQAQQBaAHcAQgBzAEEARwBVAEEASQBBAEEAOQBBAEMAQQBBAE8AUQBBAHcAQQBDAHcAQQBJAEEAQgAyAEEARwBvAEEAZABRAEIAegBBAEgAUQBBAEkAQQBBADkAQQBDAEEAQQBMAGcAQQAwAEEAQwB3AEEASQBBAEIAbwBBAEcAbwBBAGQAUQBCAHoAQQBIAFEAQQBJAEEAQQA5AEEAQwBBAEEATQBRAEEAcABBAEMAawBBAEMAZwBCAGcAQQBHAEEAQQBZAEEAQQA9AAoAcwB1AGYAZgBpAHgAOgA=:31b8e172-b470-440e-83d8-e6b185028602"
