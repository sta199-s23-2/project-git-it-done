I believe that we can use this data to determine if there are any continuities across the data that might point to how solid these UFO reports are (essentially, if they are corroborated). I do not believe there will be enough correlation across the data to support the existence of alien life.\nSeveral of the variables are categorical: date_time, city_area, state, country, ufo_shape, described_encounter_length, description, and date_documented.

The University of Rochester outlines that some physicists and astronomers strongly dispute the existence of extraterrestrial life. It’s argued that NASA is creating a commission to investigate UFOs and their connection to extraterrestrial life in order to bring some scientific credibility to the debate, by using technology to detect biosignatures. Biosignatures are signatures that we pick up on when a far-away planet is altered by its biosphere - this would be a sign of life. Overall, this article sums up how perhaps the most scientifically credible agency will get involved in the scientific research into what UFOs could mean.\nThis research question builds on the research about UFO sightings worldwide, and looks at commonalities across sightings across time and place."

The article looks at a wide range of people within the United States and factors in solely confirmed testing. The study did not include any information on the number of tests that were negative, focusing only on confirmed cases. This is significant because rather than looking at the overall response to COVID cases (i.e. increased mental health effects or differing frequency in testing based on sex), the study focused solely on who contracted COVID. The article supported the claim that men experience COVID in higher numbers.\nOur research expands beyond this in two key ways, looking at the specific impact on a geographic region and understanding the role that age plays within the COVID contraction discrepancy."

    "text": "Glimpse of data\nINTRODUCTION AND DATA\nDate and Method of Original Data Collection: These data were collected from the Coffee Quality Institute’s review pages in January 2018. These data contain reviews of 1312 arabica and 28 robusta coffee beans from the Coffee Quality Institute’s trained reviewers.\nEach observation is a review on a type of coffee.\nThere doesn’t seem to be any evident ethical concerns.\nRESEARCH QUESTION\nWhat is the relationship between the average altitude of the farm and the sweetness level of the coffee based on the country where the coffee was produced?\nThis question is important because the results of this study will demonstrate which country and at which altitude the coffee will be the sweetest or least sweet. This information will be important for coffee farmers who wish to produce sweet coffee (or vice versa) for their customers.\nOur research will investigate the relationship between the average altitude of farm where the coffee is grown and the sweetness level of the coffee produced based on the country where the coffee was produced. We hypothesize that there will be a positive correlation between the altitude and sweetness, because the literature showed that coffee beans grown at higher altitudes made coffee with a better taste.\nThe variable “Location.Country” (country where the coffee is produced) is a categorical variable, whereas the variables “Data.Scores.Sweetness” (sweetness level of the coffee on a scale of 1-10) and “Location.Altitude.Average” (the average altitude of the farm in which the coffee was grown) are quantitative variables.\nOther variables to consider would be the minimum and maximum altitudes (and the range between those two values) since our research question depends on the average altitude. One could investigate the changes in sweetness between these maximum and minimum altitude values of specific locations to supplement the research from our question about comparing countries.\nOne variable we want to control is the year, because climate/weather differences vary by year, so measuring sweetness would be best relegated to data from the same year.\nAnother variable to control would be Data.Type.Processing method, because that process would alter the condition of the coffee after its growth and thus it could affect sweetness levels.\nLITERATURE\nThis research article discusses the research into the sensory information about four different types of coffee, and how these attributes compared when coffee was grown at two different altitudes in the San Martin region of Peru. There was a 200 meter difference in the altitudes of coffee being grown and an ample amount – 1500g – of each type of coffee was grown in each location. Sensory factors “such as aroma, taste, aftertaste, acidity, body, consistency, balance, cleanliness of the cup, sweetness and beverage quality” were measured based on tables approved by the Specialty Coffee Association of America (SCAA). Moreover, the coffee tasters used to assess the coffee for this experiment were “certified by the Cooperativa Agraria Cafetalera y de Servicios Oro Verde”. \nOur research builds on the research described in this article, because it is comparing sweetness (a sensory attribute) of coffee harvested at different altitudes in a variety of regions worldwide, not just the San Martin region of Peru.\nWorks Cited:\nLiliana, E.

    "text": "library(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidymodels)\nOur topic for this project is UFOs, or “Unidentified Flying Objects”. UFOs as proof of alien life are largely written off as pseudoscience by the scientific community, but this does not take away from the fact that there are tens of thousands of sightings reported annually. In 2020, the Pentagon released videos of unidentified flying objects, sparking the intrigue of enthusiasts and skeptics alike. This is outlined in a New York Times article that also highlights how the government has been looking into unidentified aerial phenomena (UAF; another term for UFO) since the 1950s; articles like these add merit to our research into consistencies in examining UFOs worldwide. Links to NYT article: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/us/pentagon-ufo-videos.html\nThe research question we have landed on is the following: What is the relationship between the UFO shape and the length of the encounter time (in seconds) based on the country in which the UFO sighting was reported? Our hope is that this will help examine consistencies and contradictory data when investigating UFO reports worldwide.\nEthical issues do not seem to exist with this data, because we do not have any personal information about the sources of the data. All of the data is anonymous and has no identifying information which eliminates ethical concerns.\nThe data was uploaded by a man named Sam Arnold to Github on October 28, 2022. It originally came from the National UFO Reporting Center (https://nuforc.org/), and was tidied by a Github user named Sigmond Axel, originally in 2014 (https://github.com/planetsig/ufo-reports). According to the link on Github, this data was initially uploaded as a part of a Tidy Tuesday project. The cases are over 80,000 UFO sightings worldwide.\nThere are three relevant variables we’re examining from the data set: length of encounter, shape, and country. Data.Encounter duration is measured in seconds and is classified as a “double” variable. Data.shape is also a character variable, and options for this category include “disk”. Finally, the Location.country variable reports what country the particular UFO was sighted in."

We did this to help condense over 80,000 observations into a format that wasn’t overwhelming for a reader to understand. We then split up this mean time by country in order to compare the relationship in the context of our research question."

    "text": "Results\nIn order to answer the question, which is to investigate what the relationship between the UFO shape and the length of the encounter time (in seconds) is, based on the country, we decided to form scatterplot graphs, based on countries, to visualize the relationship between UFO shape and mean length of time.\nWe have come to the conclusion that in general, there is no significant correlation between all the different UFO shapes and the mean encounter time. This is exhibited by the consistently low mean encounter times for almost all UFO shapes across countries. However, depending on the country, there are specific UFO shapes that result in high outlying mean encounter times. Specifically, for Great Britain (GB), the cone shaped UFOs yield, on average, a mean encounter time of 2000000 seconds. For Canada, the shapes categorized as “other” yields, on average, around 48000 seconds. This isn’t as significant as that of the mean encounter time for cone shaped UFOs in GB, but it is also an outlier from the average encounter time of close to zero for all other UFO shapes.\nDespite these significant outliers, the overwhelmingly low average of mean encounter times across UFO shapes and the countries examined demonstrate that there is not a significant relationship between the shape of a UFO and the length of time it was encountered on Earth."
