These data contain reviews of 1312 arabica and 28 robusta coffee beans from the Coffee Quality Institute’s trained reviewers.\nEach observation is a review on a type of coffee.\nThere doesn’t seem to be any evident ethical concerns.\nRESEARCH QUESTION\nWhat is the relationship between the average altitude of the farm and the sweetness level of the coffee based on the country where the coffee was produced?\nThis question is important because the results of this study will demonstrate which country and at which altitude the coffee will be the sweetest or least sweet. This information will be important for coffee farmers who wish to produce sweet coffee (or vice versa) for their customers.\nOur research will investigate the relationship between the average altitude of farm where the coffee is grown and the sweetness level of the coffee produced based on the country where the coffee was produced. We hypothesize that there will be a positive correlation between the altitude and sweetness, because the literature showed that coffee beans grown at higher altitudes made coffee with a better taste.\nThe variable “Location.Country” (country where the coffee is produced) is a categorical variable, whereas the variables “Data.Scores.Sweetness” (sweetness level of the coffee on a scale of 1-10) and “Location.Altitude.Average” (the average altitude of the farm in which the coffee was grown) are quantitative variables.\nLITERATURE\nThis research article discusses the research into the sensory information about four different types of coffee, and how these attributes compared when coffee was grown at two different altitudes in the San Martin region of Peru. There was a 200 meter difference in the altitudes of coffee being grown and an ample amount – 1500g – of each type of coffee was grown in each location. Sensory factors “such as aroma, taste, aftertaste, acidity, body, consistency, balance, cleanliness of the cup, sweetness and beverage quality” were measured based on tables approved by the Specialty Coffee Association of America (SCAA). Moreover, the coffee tasters used to assess the coffee for this experiment were “certified by the Cooperativa Agraria Cafetalera y de Servicios Oro Verde”. \nOur research builds on the research described in this article, because it is comparing sweetness (a sensory attribute) of coffee harvested at different altitudes in a variety of regions worldwide, not just the San Martin region of Peru.\nWorks Cited:\nLiliana, E.
