    ## Introduction and Data

    Our topic is UFO sightings.
  
  Our topic for this project is UFOs, or “Unidentified Flying Objects”. UFOs as proof of alien life are largely writen off as pseudoscience by the scientific community, but this does not take away from the fact that there are tens of thousands of sightings reported annually. 
In 2020, the Pentagon released videos of unidentified flying objects, sparking the intrigue of enthusiasts and skeptics alike. This is outlined in a New York Times article that also highlights how the government has been looking into unidentified aerial phenomena (UAF; another term for UFO) since the 1950s; articles like these add merit to our research into consistencies in examining UFOs worldwide.

The research question we have landed on is the following: What is the relationship between the UFO shape and the length of the encounter time (in seconds) based on the country in which the UFO sighting was reported? Our hope is that this will help examine consistencies and contradictory data when investigating UFO reports worldwide.

Ethical issues do not seem to exist with this data, because we do not have any personal information about the sources of the data. All of the data is anonymous and has no identifying information which eliminates ethical concerns. 

The data was uploaded by a man named Sam Arnold to Github on October 28, 2022. It originally came from the National UFO Reporting Center (https://nuforc.org/), and was tidied by a Github user named Sigmond Axel, originally in 2014 (https://github.com/planetsig/ufo-reports). According to the link on Github, this data was initially uploaded as a part of a Tidy Tuesday project. The cases are over 80,000 UFO sightings worldwide.

There are three relevant variables we’re examining from the data set: length of encounter, shape, and country. Data.Encounter duration is measured in seconds and is classified as a “double” variable. Data.shape is also a character variable, and options for this category include “disk”. Finally, the Location.country variable reports what country the particular UFO was sighted in.
